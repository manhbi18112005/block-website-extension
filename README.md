An open source, site blocking/filtering extension for Google Chrome. Version 0.3.

## How to install?
- Download the full directory
- Go to chrome://extensions/ in your browser
- Click on "Load unpacked" and point to the directory in which all of the files are located.

## Features
- By default, blocking access to www.facebook.com, www.twitter.com, www.instagram.com, and www.youtube.com.
- You can view, add and delete URLs (including above) from the filtering list, by clicking on the "Show filter list" in the extension context menu (right-click on the extension icon).
- By left clicking on the icon, you can toggle the blocking functionality. The icon will appear red if filtering is turned on, and green otherwise.
- By picking "Block this page" from the context menu, you can add the current page to the filter. This can be accessed by right-clicking on any web page and picking the right option as well.
- In the options tab, it is possible to choose the extension's behaviour when it encounters blocked site (closing the tab or clearing it).
- You can set up a timer, that will switch the blocking on for a certain amount of time. During that time, it will be impossible to toggle filtering off or change the duration. You can find timer settings in "Timer mode setup" tab of the menu.
- If you happen to reinstall the extension, the list your blocked sites will be kept safe and waiting. You can then decide if you want to apply it or not.
